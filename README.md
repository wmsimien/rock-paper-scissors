# Rock Paper Scissors

## Description
This Java terminal application allows for two players or a single player vs the computer to play ROCK PAPER SCISSORS.
## Technologies Used
- Java

## Setup/Installation
1.  Clone this repository, https://github.com/wmsimien/rock-paper-scissors, to your desktop.
1.  The main file is /rockpaperscissors/RockPaperScissors.java to run the application.


## Usage
From the Start Menu, which appears when the application is run, allows to select to play 'human' to 'human' or against the 'computer'.  When the user types 'human' for that option, the user is asked to enter the username for each player.  Player one will make the first throw and then player two throws.  Then the winner will be determined base on the following rules:  Rock wins against scissors (Rock crushes scissors); paper wins against rock (paper covers rock); and scissors wins against paper (scissors cut paper).


## User Stories And Wireframe
- Have a main menu with options to enter 2 players or vs. computer.
- If the user enters 2 players, they should be able to play rock–paper–scissors against a human competitor.
- If the user enters vs. computer, they should be able to play against the computer.
- When the game is over, the winner should be declared.
